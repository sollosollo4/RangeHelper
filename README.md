# RangeHelper for Albion Online
 This application allows you to draw any kind of ellipses on top of your Albion Online game, so you can display the radius of your abilities. 
 It is possible to save your ellipse presets in xml format. In Albion Online, a lot of abilities depend on their distance. Position on the battlefield means a lot. 
 You can't go wrong, but you also have to watch out for a lot of things. The ellipses will help you relax and focus on other things such as leader calls, 
 enemy positions, reactions to enemy attacks, and more.
 Basic config includes settings for Timefreeze and Locus.

You can also find custom configurations for Carving, spirit hunter and other. In the future, all convenient configurations will be included in the base config.
This application is designed for a screen resolution of 1920x1080. How it will behave with other resolutions and extensions is unknown. But this is what concerns the basic configs. 
You can still customize your ellipses for your monitor.

Customize it the way you want! Color, size, offset of the ellipse!

The game uses a Mesh Renderer to render the circle at an angle, so the 2D ellipse cannot be accurately mapped. But basically, this is not necessary, for comfort, this is enough.
